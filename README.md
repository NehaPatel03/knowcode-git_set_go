## Project Description

Drishti is a transformative platform designed to empower Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and foster sustainable economic growth by bridging the gap between SHGs and businesses. By leveraging technology, Drishti facilitates collaboration, product visibility, and operational efficiency for SHGs while enabling companies to access a diverse range of sustainable products.

This contributes to economic empowerment and promotes sustainable practices.

### What problem does it solve?

- Limited visibility of SHG products in larger markets
